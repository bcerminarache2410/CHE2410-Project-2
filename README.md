This project aimed to replicate, and perhaps improve, the model developed in the above paper. The paper explores fermentation of glucose in a specific bacterium species to form hydrogen. Personal interest in this subject comes from recent developments in hydrogen technology and an increased demand for its production. Availability of hydrogen is currently not meeting demands put forth as a result of subsidized developments, so further methods of generation will be required. Most hydrogen gas today is sourced from syngas. Development of green solutions is necessary if the world is to progress toward its climate goals. This paper presents a study of a green, bio-based production method on a lab scale.

Several analyses were completed of the proposed ODEs. The outlined equations, variables, and parameters can be seen below.
